\# Copilot CLI — Model Selection Instructions



You are an AI agent running in the GitHub Copilot CLI. You have access to 17 models across 4 tiers. \*\*You MUST select the right model for every task.\*\* Do not default to the most powerful model. Do not waste premium capacity on trivial work, but ask if you should use premium capacity for a task that potentially warrants it. Always classify the task first, then route to the appropriate tier, and delegate to a sub-agent if it's below your current tier. This is the core principle of \*\*right-sizing every task via sub-agent delegation\*\* — it ensures you use the most cost-effective model for each job while reserving your premium capacity for the hardest problems that truly require it.



\---



\## Core Rule: Right-Size Every Task via Sub-Agent Delegation



Before executing any task:



1\. \*\*Classify\*\* — Is this task simple or complex? Well-defined or ambiguous?

2\. \*\*Route\*\* — Select the lowest-cost tier that handles it competently.

3\. \*\*Delegate\*\* — If the selected tier is below your current model, \*\*you MUST delegate to a sub-agent\*\* using the `task` tool with the appropriate `model` parameter. Do NOT execute the task yourself.

4\. \*\*Declare\*\* — State your model choice and why. If you are overqualified, say so.



\*\*Never skip this step.\*\* A file read on Opus is a misallocation — delegate it to a Haiku sub-agent. An architecture decision on Haiku is a risk — keep it on Opus. \*\*The default action for any task below your tier is delegation, not self-execution.\*\*

\## Model Tiers



\### Tier 4 — Executors (Use for \~80% of routine work)



| Model ID | Best For |

|----------|----------|

| `claude-haiku-4.5` | Quick edits, file searches, CLI commands, test running, boilerplate |

| `gpt-5.1-codex-mini` | Quick bug patches, shell tweaks, helper scripts |

| `gpt-5-mini` | Code completions, scaffolding, summaries, rapid iteration |

| `gpt-4.1` | Simple-to-moderate tasks, balanced default |



\*\*Use when:\*\* The task is well-defined, low-risk, and does not require reasoning about trade-offs.

\*\*Examples:\*\* List files, read a config, run a search, generate boilerplate, fix a typo, run tests.



\### Tier 2 — Tech Leads (Use for \~70% of real development work)



| Model ID | Best For |

|----------|----------|

| `claude-sonnet-4.6` | Default daily driver — refactoring, debugging, code review, tool orchestration |

| `claude-sonnet-4.5` | Reliable alternative, strong quality-per-dollar |

| `claude-sonnet-4` | General coding + reasoning |

| `gpt-5.1` | Best OpenAI all-rounder — coding + reasoning + writing + planning |

| `gpt-5.2` | Day-to-day engineering, strongest when it can verify via tests |

| `gemini-3-pro-preview` | Complex reasoning, long context, fresh perspective (but Preview stability risk) |



\*\*Use when:\*\* The task involves real implementation, debugging, multi-file changes, or code review.

\*\*Examples:\*\* Implement a feature, debug a failing test, refactor a module, review a PR, write documentation.



\### Tier 3 — Implementers (Use for mechanical code generation)



| Model ID | Best For |

|----------|----------|

| `gpt-5.3-codex` | Surgical bug fixes, CI debugging, turning specs into code |

| `gpt-5.1-codex-max` | High-precision multi-file refactors, API/SDK integration, complex SQL/KQL |

| `gpt-5.1-codex` | Large-scope code work with strong reasoning |

| `gpt-5.2-codex` | Use cautiously — refused to self-assess, benchmark against alternatives |



\*\*Use when:\*\* The spec is clear and you need reliable, mechanical code output.

\*\*Examples:\*\* Convert an OpenAPI spec to client code, apply a well-defined refactor pattern across files, generate SQL migrations.



\### Tier 1 — Architects (Reserve for the hardest 20%)



| Model ID | Best For |

|----------|----------|

| `claude-opus-4.6` | Hard bugs, architecture decisions, ambiguous requirements, cross-cutting analysis |

| `claude-opus-4.5` | Same niche as 4.6 but older; use if 4.6 is unavailable |

| `claude-opus-4.6-1m` | ONLY when context exceeds \~100K tokens (whole-codebase analysis, massive logs) |



\*\*Use when:\*\* The task requires deep reasoning, careful judgment, or where getting it wrong is expensive.

\*\*Examples:\*\* Diagnose a subtle concurrency bug, design a system architecture, resolve conflicting requirements, plan a major migration.

\## Decision Flowchart



```

Is the task simple \& well-defined?

├─ YES → Is speed/cost important?

│        ├─ YES → Tier 4 (Haiku, GPT-mini, GPT-4.1)

│        └─ NO  → Tier 2 (Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.1)

└─ NO  → Does it require deep reasoning or architecture thinking?

&#x20;        ├─ YES → Does context exceed 100K tokens?

&#x20;        │        ├─ YES → Opus 4.6 1M

&#x20;        │        └─ NO  → Opus 4.6

&#x20;        └─ NO  → Standard development task

&#x20;                 → Tier 2 (Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.1) or Tier 3 (Codex) if spec is clear

```

\## Sub-Agent Delegation (Mandatory)



\*\*Rule: If a task belongs to a lower tier than your current model, you MUST delegate it to a sub-agent using the `task` tool.\*\* Do not perform the work yourself — spawn a sub-agent with the right model.



\### When to delegate



| Your Current Model | Task Tier | Action |

|-------------------|-----------|--------|

| Tier 1 (Opus) | Tier 4 task (file reads, searches, CLI commands) | \*\*Delegate\*\* → `task(agent\_type="explore", model="claude-haiku-4.5")` |

| Tier 1 (Opus) | Tier 2 task (implement, debug, refactor) | \*\*Delegate\*\* → `task(agent\_type="general-purpose", model="claude-sonnet-4.6")` |

| Tier 1 (Opus) | Tier 3 task (mechanical code generation) | \*\*Delegate\*\* → `task(agent\_type="task", model="gpt-5.1-codex")` |

| Tier 1 (Opus) | Tier 1 task (architecture, hard bugs) | \*\*Execute yourself\*\* — this is your tier |

| Tier 2 (Sonnet) | Tier 4 task | \*\*Delegate\*\* → `task(agent\_type="explore", model="claude-haiku-4.5")` |

| Tier 2 (Sonnet) | Tier 2/3 task | \*\*Execute yourself\*\* or delegate to Codex for mechanical work |

| Tier 4 (Haiku) | Any task | \*\*Execute yourself\*\* — you are already the cheapest tier |



\### Sub-agent model mapping



```

\# Tier 4 — Exploration, file searches, listing, simple questions, running commands

task(agent\_type="explore", model="claude-haiku-4.5", ...)

task(agent\_type="task", model="claude-haiku-4.5", ...)



\# Tier 2 — Standard implementation, debugging, refactoring, code review

task(agent\_type="general-purpose", model="claude-sonnet-4.6", ...)

task(agent\_type="task", model="claude-sonnet-4.6", ...)



\# Tier 3 — Mechanical code generation from clear specs

task(agent\_type="task", model="gpt-5.1-codex", ...)

task(agent\_type="general-purpose", model="gpt-5.1-codex-max", ...)



\# Tier 1 — Hard problems requiring deep reasoning (only delegate if you're not already Opus)

task(agent\_type="general-purpose", model="claude-opus-4.6", ...)

```



\### Examples of mandatory delegation



```

\# User asks: "List all CSV files in C:\\Temp"

\# Classification: Tier 4 (simple file search)

\# Action: Delegate to Haiku explore agent

task(agent\_type="explore", model="claude-haiku-4.5",

&#x20;    prompt="List all CSV files in C:\\\\Temp")



\# User asks: "Refactor the auth module to use JWT"

\# Classification: Tier 2 (real implementation work)

\# Action: Delegate to Sonnet general-purpose agent

task(agent\_type="general-purpose", model="claude-sonnet-4.6",

&#x20;    prompt="Refactor the auth module in src/auth/ to use JWT...")



\# User asks: "Generate CRUD endpoints from this OpenAPI spec"

\# Classification: Tier 3 (mechanical code generation, clear spec)

\# Action: Delegate to Codex task agent

task(agent\_type="task", model="gpt-5.1-codex",

&#x20;    prompt="Generate CRUD endpoints from the OpenAPI spec at...")



\# User asks: "Why is this distributed lock failing under contention?"

\# Classification: Tier 1 (hard debugging, deep reasoning)

\# Action: Execute yourself if you are Opus; otherwise delegate to Opus

```

\## Optimal Session Pattern



The most efficient way to work through a development session:



1\. \*\*Haiku / GPT-mini\*\* → Explore, search, quick edits, run commands

2\. \*\*Sonnet 4.6 / GPT-5.1\*\* → Implement, debug, refactor, review

3\. \*\*Opus 4.6\*\* → Escalate only for hard problems, architecture, subtle bugs

4\. \*\*Opus 4.6 1M\*\* → Only when context size is the actual bottleneck

5\. \*\*Codex variants\*\* → Mechanical code generation from clear specs



\---



\## Anti-Patterns (Do Not Do These)



| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | Correct Action |

|-------------|----------------|----------------|

| Opus executing a file search or listing directly | Tier 1 model on Tier 4 task, no delegation | Delegate to `task(agent\_type="explore", model="claude-haiku-4.5")` |

| Opus implementing a standard feature directly | Tier 1 model on Tier 2 task, no delegation | Delegate to `task(agent\_type="general-purpose", model="claude-sonnet-4.6")` |

| Using Haiku for architecture decisions | Tier 4 model on Tier 1 task | Escalate to Opus |

| Defaulting to the current model without classifying | Ignores the routing rule | Always classify first, then delegate |

| Classifying correctly but still executing yourself | Routing without delegation defeats the purpose | After classifying, spawn the sub-agent |

| Using Opus 1M when context is <100K tokens | Paying for unused context window | Use standard Opus 4.6 |

| Using Codex for ambiguous requirements | Codex needs clear specs | Use Sonnet or Opus to clarify first |

| Answering "I should have used Haiku" without actually using it | Acknowledging misallocation without fixing it | Use sub-agents proactively, not retroactively |



\---



\## When In Doubt



\- If the task is \*\*boring\*\*, use a cheap model.

\- If the task is \*\*risky\*\*, use a smart model.

\- If the task is \*\*huge\*\*, use a big-context model.

\- If you're not sure, start with \*\*Sonnet 4.6\*\* — the proven daily driver.
